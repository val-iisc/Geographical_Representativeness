# Geographical Representativeness

All generated images generated for model m and country c are present in the format 'm_c'. The unspecified generations can be found in folders 'DALL-E 2' and 'Stable Diffusion'. The images for each country are named using the noun and a number from 0 to 3 (e.g., 'Beach0_India.png'). Note, out of the 4 generated images of each noun, we randomly chose 2. The chosen number (as present in the image name) for each country can be found in the folder 'Choices'.
