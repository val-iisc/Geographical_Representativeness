# Geographical Representativeness

**Generated Images** All generated images generated for model m and country c are present in the format 'm_c' (eg. 'Stable Diffusion_India'). The unspecified generations can be found in folders 'DALL-E 2' and 'Stable Diffusion'. The images for each country are named using the noun and a number from 0 to 3 (e.g., 'Beach0_India.png'). Note, out of the 4 generated images of each noun, we randomly chose 2. The chosen numbers (as present in the image name) for each country can be found in the folder 'Choices'. 

**Responses** The responses for each country can be found in the folder 'Responses'. The order of the nouns in the responses is *city, beach, house, flag, road, dress, flag, park, wedding, kitchen*. For a single noun (e.g. city), we have 8 responses. The first 4 are for DALL.E 2, the other 4 for Stable Diffusion. Each of these 4 are divided into two equal parts: responses for prompts *without* country names and those *with* country names respectively. Note that the displayed images to the participants of a certain country are dependent on the numbers in the folder 'Choices'. For every participant, we also asked 4 trick questions to test their attention span. We have included these in the responses as well.
